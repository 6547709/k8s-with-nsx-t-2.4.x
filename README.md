The goal of this series of posts is to outline and explain the steps to integrate VMware NSX-T Platform with Kubernetes. 

Software components used are shown below.

- vCenter 6.7 U1b (Build 11727113)
- ESX 6.7 U2 (Build 13006603)
- NSX-T 2.4.1 (Build 13716579)
- NSX Container Plugin 2.4.1 (Build 13515827)
- Ubuntu Server 16.04.5
- Docker CE 18.09.6
- Kubernetes 1.14.2
- Open vSwitch 2.10.2.13185890

It is highly recommended to check the following resources for compatibility requirements
* VMware Product Interoperability Matrices  
https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&175=&2=&1=
* VMware NSX Container Plugin Release Notes 
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/index.html

This series does NOT provide the 101 level info neither on NSX-T nor on K8S. To have a basic understanding of NSX-T please watch the VMworld 2018 session recordings. For K8S, Pluralsight and A Cloud Guru trainings by Nigel Poulton is highly recommended.  

Below articles focus on the basic integration principles of NSX-T and K8S. Hopefully we will be able to dive into details and troubleshooting in upcoming articles.
